You are the captain of the Simon, a treasure-hunting ship. Your current mission
is to find the three sunken treasure chests that are lurking in the part of the
ocean you are in and collect them.

To play, enter the coordinates of the point in the ocean you wish to drop a
sonar device. The sonar can find out how far away the closest chest is to it.
For example, the d below marks where the device was dropped, and the 2's
represent distances of 2 away from the device. The 4's represent
distances of 4 away from the device.

The point where the device was dropped will be marked with a 2.
The treasure chests donâ€™t move around. Sonar devices can detect treasure
chests up to a distance of 9. If all chests are out of range, the point
will be marked with O
If a device is directly dropped on a treasure chest, you have discovered
the location of the chest, and it will be collected. The sonar device will
remain there.
When you collect a chest, all sonar devices will update to locate the next
closest sunken treasure chest.
